# Neural Network Hyperparameter Tuning Script

This repository contains a Python script that uses Keras (via TensorFlow) to build and train a neural network on the California Housing dataset, with functionality for hyperparameter tuning using `scikeras` and `scikit-learn`.

## Prerequisites

This script is built and tested with the following versions of the main libraries:

- **TensorFlow**: `2.18.0`
- **scikit-learn**: `1.3.2`
- **scikeras**: `0.12.0`

## Installation

To install the required libraries with the specified versions, you can create a virtual environment and use the following steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On **Windows**:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow==2.18.0
    pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2
    pip install scikeras==0.12.0
    ```

4. **Verify the Installation** (optional):
    After installation, you can verify the versions by running the following in a Python shell or script:
    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    import sklearn
    import scikeras
    
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print(f"scikit-learn version: {sklearn.__version__}")
    print(f"scikeras version: {scikeras.__version__}")
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the Python script to train the neural network model and perform hyperparameter tuning on the California Housing dataset.

### Example

1. Open the terminal (or command prompt) in the folder containing the script.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

### Notes:
- Ensure that your Python version is **3.7 to 3.11** for compatibility with TensorFlow 2.18.0.
- If using a GPU, make sure that the necessary CUDA and cuDNN drivers are properly installed.
